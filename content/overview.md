## What Problems do Protocol Buffers Solve? {#solve}

* recommended for
  * ephemeral network traffic &
    * _Example:_ inter-server communications 
  * long-term data storage
    * _Example:_ archival storage of data | disk 
  * serialize data types, structured & record-like | manner language-neutral, platform-neutral & extensible
  * defining communication protocols
  * maintain backwards compatibility

## What are the Benefits of Using Protocol Buffers? {#benefits}

* benefits of using it
  * Compact data storage
  * Fast parsing
  * Availability in many programming languages
  * Optimized functionality through automatically-generated classes

### Cross-language Compatibility {#cross-lang}

The same messages can be read by code written in any supported programming
language. You can have a Java program on one platform capture data from one
software system, serialize it based on a `.proto` definition, and then extract
specific values from that serialized data in a separate Python application
running on another platform.

The following languages are supported directly in the protocol buffers compiler,
protoc:

*   [C++](/reference/cpp/cpp-generated#invocation)
*   [C#](/reference/csharp/csharp-generated#invocation)
*   [Java](/reference/java/java-generated#invocation)
*   [Kotlin](/reference/kotlin/kotlin-generated#invocation)
*   [Objective-C](/reference/objective-c/objective-c-generated#invocation)
*   [PHP](/reference/php/php-generated#invocation)
*   [Python](/reference/python/python-generated#invocation)
*   [Ruby](/reference/ruby/ruby-generated#invocation)

The following languages are supported by Google, but the projects' source code
resides in GitHub repositories. The protoc compiler uses plugins for these
languages:

<!-- mdformat off(mdformat adds a space between the ) and the {) -->
*   [Dart](https://github.com/google/protobuf.dart)
*   [Go](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf-go)
<!-- mdformat on -->

Additional languages are not directly supported by Google, but rather by other
GitHub projects. These languages are covered in
[Third-Party Add-ons for Protocol Buffers](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/master/docs/third_party.md).

### Cross-project Support {#cross-proj}

You can use protocol buffers across projects by defining `message` types in
`.proto` files that reside outside of a specific project‚Äôs code base. If you're
defining `message` types or enums that you anticipate will be widely used
outside of your immediate team, you can put them in their own file with no
dependencies.

A couple of examples of proto definitions widely-used within Google are
[`timestamp.proto`](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/master/src/google/protobuf/timestamp.proto)
and
[`status.proto`](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/rpc/status.proto).

### Updating Proto Definitions Without Updating Code {#updating-defs}

* backward & forward compatible As long as you follow some
  * follow [simple practices](/programming-guides/proto3/#updating)
  * forward compatible ==
    * old code -- ignoring any new added fields, will read -- new messages
    * new code -- ignore new fields, wil read -- old messages

### When are Protocol Buffers not a Good Fit? {#not-good-fit}

* data > 1MB
  * Reason: üß†Protocol buffers assume that entire messages 
    * -- can be loaded into memory -- | 1!
    * < object graph üß† 
  * consider another alternative
  * side impacts
    * spikes | memory usage
      * Reason: üß† serialized copies -> several copies of the data üß† 
* need to compare messages
  * Reason: üß† 
    * if protocol buffers are serialized -> can exist several binary serializations / SAME data 
    * -> FULLY parsing them üß†
* messages are NOT compressed
  * Reason: üß† produce much smaller files üß†
    * _Example:_ use JPEG and PNG
* usig large multi-dimensional arrays of floating point numbers
  * Reason: üß† NOT efficient neither size nor speed üß†
  * Solution: use other formats -- [FITS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FITS) --
* NOT-object-oriented languages
  * Reason: üß†NOT well-supported üß†
  * _Example:_ Fortran
* NOT possible to fully interpret a .proto` / -- WITHOUT accessing to -- it
  * Reason: üß†Protocol buffer messages do NOT inherently self-describe their data üß†
* environments / require to build on standards
  * Reason: üß† protocol buffers are NOT a formal standard of any organization üß†

## Who Uses Protocol Buffers? {#who-uses}

* üëÅÔ∏èMOST commonly-used data format | Google üëÅÔ∏è
* [gRPC](https://grpc.io)
* [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com)
* [Envoy Proxy](https://www.envoyproxy.io)

## How do Protocol Buffers Work? {#work}

![](protocol-buffers-concepts.png) 

* .java, .py, .cc / generated by protocol buffers -- provide -- utility methods to
  * retrieve data -- from -- files & streams
  * extract individual values -- from -- data
  * check if data exists
  * serialize data back to -- file OR stream
  * ...
* _Example:_

```proto
message Person {
  optional string name = 1;
  optional int32 id = 2;
  optional string email = 3;
}
```

compiling `.proto` -> creates a `Builder` class / you can use to

```java
Person john = Person.newBuilder()
    .setId(1234)
    .setName("John Doe")
    .setEmail("jdoe@example.com")
    .build();
output = new FileOutputStream(args[0]);
john.writeTo(output);
```

you can deserialize data -- via -- methods protocol buffers | other languages like C++

```cpp
Person john;
fstream input(argv[1], ios::in | ios::binary);
john.ParseFromIstream(&input);
int id = john.id();
std::string name = john.name();
std::string email = john.email();
```

## Protocol Buffers Definition Syntax {#syntax}

* fields
  * `optionality dataType nameToGive numberToGive`
    * optionality
      * `optional`  -- proto2 & proto3--
      * `repeated` -- proto2 & proto3 --
      * `required` -- proto2 --
    * dataType 
      * Scalar value types -- Check [Scalar Value Types](/programming-guides/proto3#scalar) --
      * `message`
        * allows
          * üëÅnesting parts üëÅ
      * `enum`
        * allows
          * üëÅspecifying a set of values from üëÅ
      * `oneof`
        * uses
          * if it has got several optional fields, BUT >=1 it's set
      * `map`
    * nameToGive
      * ‚ö†Ô∏èonce they are set & used in production -> impossible to change ‚ö†Ô∏è
      * Check 'programmingGuide/style'
      * ‚ö†Ô∏è do NOT use `-` ‚ö†Ô∏è
      * if field is repeated -> use pluralized names
    * numberToGive
      * ‚ö†Ô∏è can NOT be reused ‚ö†Ô∏è
        * == although you delete the field -> NOT reassign it
    * [Specifying Field Rules](/programming-guides/proto3#specifying-field-rules).)
* extensions
  * üëÅ ONLY allowed | "proto2" üëÅ
  * allows
    * fields -- are defined -- outside of the message
  * _Example:_ the protobuf library's internal message schema -- allows extensions for -- custom, usage-specific options
* check
  * [proto2](/programming-guides/proto2)
  * [proto3](/programming-guides/proto3)

* TODO:
After setting optionality and field type, you choose a name for the field.
There are some things to keep in mind when setting field names:

*   It can sometimes be difficult, or even impossible, to change field names
    after they've been used in production.
*   Field names cannot contain dashes. For more on field name syntax, see
    [Message and Field Names](/programming-guides/style#message-field-names).
*   Use pluralized names for repeated fields.

After assigning a name to the field, you assign a field number. Field
numbers cannot be repurposed or reused. If you delete a field, you should
reserve its field number to prevent someone from accidentally reusing the
number.

## Additional Data Type Support {#data-types}

Protocol buffers support many scalar value types, including integers that use
both variable-length encoding and fixed sizes. You can also create your own
composite data types by defining messages that are, themselves, data types that
you can assign to a field. In addition to the simple and composite value types,
several [common types](/programming-guides/dos-donts#common)
are published.

## History {#history}

* [History of Protocol Buffers](/history)

## Protocol Buffers Open Source Philosophy {#philosophy}

Protocol buffers were open sourced in 2008 as a way to provide developers
outside of Google with the same benefits that we derive from them internally. We
support the open source community through regular updates to the language as we
make those changes to support our internal requirements. While we accept select
pull requests from external developers, we cannot always prioritize feature
requests and bug fixes that don‚Äôt conform to Google‚Äôs specific needs.

## Developer Community {#community}

protobuf developers and users,
